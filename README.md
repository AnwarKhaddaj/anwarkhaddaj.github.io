    <span style="font-size: 15px">üë®‚Äçüéì</span> I am a graduate student in Computational Applied Mathematics and Operations Research at <a href="https://cmor.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a>. <br/><br/>
    <span style="font-size: 15px">üß†</span>My research is on parameter estimation in large-scale differential equations, applied to the field of computational neuroscience.<br/><br/>
    <span style="font-size: 15px;">üñ•Ô∏è</span> I am passionate about applied mathematics, software engineering and high performance computing. Above all, I enjoy the excitement of tackling challenging scientific research problems. <br/><br/>
    <span style="font-size: 15px">üì∑</span> I recently got into photography and I enjoy adding captions to the pictures I take to bring them into perspective. Check out my page  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/captured_thoughtsandmemories/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br/><br/>
    <span style="font-size: 15px">üë®‚Äçüíº</span> I am also interested in entrepreneurship. I cofounded a startup called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/82903389/admin/feed/posts/" target="_blank">Stoodie</a> in Feb 2022, and made it to national TV in Lebanon.
